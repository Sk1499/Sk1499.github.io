    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    
    <p>Ajay Kapoor, will change the way you look at the market. Literally!
    <p>He has been trading in the stock market since 1991.He earned major 
        profits through his self-developed trading plans and started conducting 
        trainings and seminars in 2010 enabling traders to convert their 
        past failures into success stories.</p>
    <p>He believes that in trading, one should align the trades with that 
        of the operators to make profit. Secondly, Money Management and balance 
        of mind are more important than the strategies.</p>
    <p>As an experienced meditation teacher also, he understands the 
        psychology of the traders as well as the operators. He has devised
        Bisaat - automatic ways of trading strategies that will ensure peace 
        of mind and consistent profits. </p>

    <div class="about-bisaat">
    <span class="a"><h1>What is Bisaat</h1>
    <p>Bisaat is a matrix of softwares on the Amibroker platform. 
        It involves trading in multiple time frames with exact entry
        and exit points. These strategies have been highly optimized 
        over a period of several years.  We will place these strategies
        on your desktop. You just have to wait for the Entry and Exit 
        signals to trade.  The pic below contains Bank Nifty Intraday 
        Bisaat in five time frames: 1m, 2m, 3m, 5m and 15m.</p>

    <span class="c"><h1>Why Bisaat</h1>
    <p>If you are not a gambler, Bisaat will help you.
        We, at Bisaat, have developed a system of trading 
        that can give you consistent returns.  The idea is 
        to beat the Smart Moneyin their game itself. We 
        have understood their strategies and can help you 
        overcome your trading mistakes . We believe that 
        you should not enter the stock market if you wish
        to make zillions with a meager capital. It is like 
        any other business with its pros and cons. If you 
        have the right strategy, right mindset and a disciplined 
        money-management system, there is every chance that 
        you would be successful. The pic below contains 
        Bank Nifty Intraday Results of the last 1 year on a 
        eight-min candle for one lot.</p></span>

<div class="about-learn">
    <span class="left"><h1>Common mistakes that you will unlearn</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Not squaring off at the right time and turning profits into losses</li>
        <li>Fear of missing opportunity that makes traders enter trades at the wrong time</li>
        <li>Trading against the trend in the hope that market is going to turn soon</li>
        <li>Very bad money management using leverages given by the brokers</li>
        <li>Not employing Options to gain time value in the positional trades</li>
        <li>Not hedging the trades to avoid big losses</li>
    </ul>
</span>
    <span class="right"><h1>What you will learn</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> A multi time-frame strategy: From 1 minute to 3 hours. This is how you outsmart
            the operators.</li>
        <li>Money Management: Your strategy should also be more than 50% right
             and should have a minimum Risk-Reward ratio of 1:2.</li>
        <li>Discipline: Follow the plan consistently.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>For catering to these three points, we have developed BISAAT Trading system in which the 
        possibility of going wrong is minimum and that of success is maximum.</h5 >
