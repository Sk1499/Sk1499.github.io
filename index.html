    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    
    <p>Ajay Kapoor, will change the way you look at the market. Literally!<br>
    <p>He has been trading in the stock market since 1991.He earned major <br>
        profits through his self-developed trading plans and started conducting <br>
        trainings and seminars in 2010 enabling traders to convert their <br>
        past failures into success stories.</p>
    <p>He believes that in trading, one should align the trades with that <br>
        of the operators to make profit. Secondly, Money Management and balance <br>
        of mind are more important than the strategies.</p>
    <p>As an experienced meditation teacher also, he understands the <br>
        psychology of the traders as well as the operators. He has devised<br> 
        Bisaat - automatic ways of trading strategies that will ensure peace <br>
        of mind and consistent profits. </p>

    <div class="about-bisaat">
    <span class="a"><h1>What is Bisaat</h1>
    <p>Bisaat is a matrix of softwares on the Amibroker platform. <br>
        It involves trading in multiple time frames with exact entry<br> 
        and exit points. These strategies have been highly optimized <br>
        over a period of several years.  We will place these strategies<br> 
        on your desktop. You just have to wait for the Entry and Exit <br>
        signals to trade.  The pic below contains Bank Nifty Intraday <br>
        Bisaat in five time frames: 1m, 2m, 3m, 5m and 15m.</p>

    <span><h1>Why Bisaat</h1>
    <p>If you are not a gambler, Bisaat will help you.<br>
        We, at Bisaat, have developed a system of trading <br>
        that can give you consistent returns.  The idea is <br>
        to beat the Smart Moneyin their game itself. We <br>
        have understood their strategies and can help you <br>
        overcome your trading mistakes . We believe that <br>
        you should not enter the stock market if you wish <br>
        to make zillions with a meager capital. It is like <br>
        any other business with its pros and cons. If you <br>
        have the right strategy, right mindset and a disciplined <br>
        money-management system, there is every chance that <br>
        you would be successful. The pic below contains <br>

<div class="about-learn">
    <span class="left"><h1>Common mistakes that you will unlearn</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Not squaring off at the right time and turning profits into losses</li>
        <li>Fear of missing opportunity that makes traders enter trades at the wrong time</li>
        <li>Trading against the trend in the hope that market is going to turn soon</li>
        <li>Very bad money management using leverages given by the brokers</li>
        <li>Not employing Options to gain time value in the positional trades</li>
        <li>Not hedging the trades to avoid big losses</li>
    </ul>
</span>
    <span><h1>What you will learn</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> A multi time-frame strategy: From 1 minute to 3 hours. This is how you outsmart <br>the operators.</li>
        <li>Money Management: Your strategy should also be more than 50% right<br> and should <br> have a minimum Risk-Reward ratio of 1:2.</li>
        <li>Discipline: Follow the plan consistently.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>For catering to these three points, we have developed BISAAT Trading system in which the <br>possibility of going wrong is minimum and that of success is maximum.</h5 >
