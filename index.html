    <p>Ajay Kapoor, will change the way you look at the market. Literally!
    <p>He has been trading in the stock market since 1991.<br>
        He earned major profits through his self-developed <br>
        trading plans and started conducting trainings and seminars in 2010<br>
        enabling traders to convert their past failures into success stories.</p>
    <p>He believes that in trading, one should align the trades <br>
        with that of the operators to make profit.<br>
        Secondly, Money Management and balance of <br>
        mind are more important than the strategies.</p>
    <p>As an experienced meditation teacher also,<br> 
        he understands the psychology of the traders<br> 
        as well as the operators. He has devised<br> 
        Bisaat - automatic ways of trading strategies <br>
        that will ensure peace of mind and consistent profits. </p>
    <h1>What is Bisaat</h1>
